## Epub Readers

1. ### ttsu web epub reader
    [https://reader.ttsu.app/](https://reader.ttsu.app/)

     >[!tip]
    Cons:
    Some epub files cannot be loaded.

2. ### Publish Epub to telegra.ph

    >[!tip]
    Plugin -> Settings -> Epub conversion tool for automatic publishing.
    The purpose is to convert epub to a pure web page, making it fully compatible with Lingkuma across all platforms.

3. ### Plugin Built-in Epub Processing Script

    >[!tip]
    >1. Format fixing: If the epub text size and style cannot be customized, this method can be tried.
    >2. Chapter splitting: Facilitates publishing to telegra.ph or reduces the amount of text per chapter, reducing potential lagging.
    >3. Japanese ruby furigana cleanup: Can fix highlighting and text acquisition errors when looking up words.

## PDF Readers

### Mozilla PDF web reader
[https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html)

>[!tip]
Cons:
No bookshelf UI, requires re-importing every time.

## Readest Reader

>[!tip]
Pros:
Supports Epub, PDF, and book management.
Cons:
iOS is not compatible with Lingkuma highlighting.

 ### PC Settings Recommendation

Only disable tap-to-turn-page. When highlighting is on the first or last line, it will trigger translation. Disabling it solves this.

**Tablets** may not trigger taps on empty space. You can tap anywhere to bring up the **progress panel**, which has page turning buttons on the left and right.
