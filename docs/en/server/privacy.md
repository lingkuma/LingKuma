Thank you for using lingkuma! This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and why.

1. Information We Collect:
For Subscription Verification: To verify your subscription status and unlock premium features, we may collect your User ID from Afdian and/or your User ID and Token from OhMyGpt, but only if you choose to provide them in the settings.
User Configuration (Stored Locally): Settings you configure within the extension, such as custom AI API Base URLs, API Keys, AI model names, TTS preferences, and custom prompts, are stored **only** in your browser's (e.g., Chrome, Edge) local storage (using `chrome.storage` or similar browser APIs). **We, the developers, do not have access to this information.**

2. How We Use Your Information:
The collected User IDs and Tokens (Afdian/OhMyGpt) are used solely for verifying your subscription status with the respective platforms.
The OhMyGpt Token is used to directly communicate with the OhMyGpt API on your behalf when you select OhMyGpt as your AI provider.
Your locally stored custom API configurations (Base URL, Key, Model) are used by the extension to directly communicate with the AI service **you** have specified. **These credentials are never sent to our servers.**
We **do not** track your browsing activity or collect personal data beyond what's stated above.

3. Data Storage and Security:
All collected User IDs/Tokens and user configurations are stored securely within your browser's storage area (e.g., Chrome's or Edge's) associated with this extension on your computer.
We rely on the security mechanisms provided by your browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge) to protect this local data.

4. Data Sharing:
We **will never** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information (User IDs, Tokens) to outside parties.
When you use a custom AI API or the OhMyGpt service through our extension, your requests (which may include the text you process and the necessary API credentials stored locally) are sent directly from your browser to the respective third-party service. Your interaction with these third-party services is governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them.

5. Your Choices:
You can review and modify your configurations at any time within the extension's settings page.
You can remove stored User IDs, Tokens, and custom API details by clearing the respective fields in the settings.
Uninstalling the extension will remove all associated data stored by it in your browser.

6. Changes to This Policy:
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
