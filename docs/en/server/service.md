You agree to use the extension responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
You are responsible for configuring and securing any third-party API keys or credentials you use with the extension.

2. Payments and Donations:
Please Note: All payments made in relation to this extension (e.g., via Afdian or OhMyGpt for subscription benefits) are considered voluntary donations to support the project's development and maintenance. These payments are not fees for purchasing a guaranteed service or product.
Donations do not guarantee the continued availability, functionality, or specific features of the extension. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any or all parts of the service or features associated with donations at any time, without prior notice and without obligation for refunds.

3. Disclaimer of Warranties:
The extension is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the extension will be error-free or uninterrupted.
OhMyGpt is an independent, third-party AI service. By choosing to use OhMyGpt through Lingkuma, you agree to comply with all applicable local laws and regulations regarding its use. Lingkuma merely provides a technical interface to connect to OhMyGpt and does not provide any AI services itself. You are solely responsible for your usage of OhMyGpt and any consequences that may arise. Lingkuma assumes no liability for your actions or the content generated via OhMyGpt.

4. Limitation of Liability:
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developers of Lingkuma shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the extension.

5. Changes to Terms:
We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. We will notify users of significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the extension after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
